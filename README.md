Project to collect data on the current **Blood Stock Position** of the Pró-Sangue Foundation of the state of São Paulo Brazil.

## Synopsis

The project is a *web scraper* that collects the blood stock position on the Pro-Blood Foundation of São Paulo website. The idea is to have a dataset with the collected data to be used for analysis and warning (threshold). The data is transformed a Json by a Python micro-service. Nifi creates the data pipeline, and sends the information to Elasticsearch, which Kibana can use to create the visualizations and dashboards. 

For this test the environments were dockerized and the web scraper runs on the local machine.

 
### Architecture

  * Python
  * Nifi
